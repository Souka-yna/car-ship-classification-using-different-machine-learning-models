# cqr-ship-classification-using-different-machine-learning-models
In this workshop we tried to classify images, passing by the extraction of the characteristics to the search of the best values of the parameters of the models, to the training of the models, arriving finally to predict the classes of the not classified images and comparing the results given by these models.

The main objective of this project is to create an image classification system based on Machine Learning and Data Mining algorithms. Classification is the process of predicting the class of a given image. Classes are sometimes called labels or categories. As with CBIR, classification will be performed based on the image descriptor vector instead of using the image.
