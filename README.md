# car-ship-classification-using-different-machine-learning-models

The main objective of this project is to create an image classification system based on Machine Learning and Data Mining algorithms. Classification is the process of predicting the class of a given image. Classes are sometimes called labels or categories. As with CBIR, classification will be performed based on the image descriptor vector instead of using the image.
